This is a conversion of the browser-detector element from gauravkk22 (https://github.com/gauravkk22/browser-detector) with some minor adjustments. The readme was not updated and is still the one from the original browser-detector element! The original browser-detector was updated to Polymer 3 nowadays and is probably a better choice than this one.
